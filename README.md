# MTG-boosters
A site where you can put in a mtg set code and get a booster from the set.
not for commercial use, this is for practice.

this app uses MTG Developer API, occasionally some of the sets are not able to be accessed. If no pack appears, this is likely the cause.
LEA is a set that seems to work always, test with this set if required.
